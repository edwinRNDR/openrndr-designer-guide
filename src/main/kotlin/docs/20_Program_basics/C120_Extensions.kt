    # Extensions

    Extensions add functionality to a Program. Extensions can be used to control how a program draws, setup keyboard and
    mouse bindings and much more.

    ## Basic extension use
    
    Here we demonstrate how to use an OPENRNDR extension. The extension that we use is the `Screenshots` extension, which, when 
    the space bar is pressed will capture the application window's contents and save it to a timestamped file.
    """

    @Code
    application {
        program {
            // -- one time setup code goes here
            extend(Screenshots())
            extend {

                // -- drawing code goes here
            }
        }
    }

    @Text 
    """
    ## Extension configuration
    
    Some extensions have configurable options. They can be set using the configuring `extend` function as follows:
    """

    @Code
    application {
        program {
            extend(Screenshots()) {
                contentScale = 4.0
            }
        }
    }

    @Text 
    """
    ## Extension functions
    
    The functional `extend` function allows one to use a single function as an extension. This is commonly used to
    create a "draw loop".
    """

    @Code
    application {
        program {
            extend {
                drawer.circle(width / 2.0, height / 2.0, 50.0)
            }
        }
    }

    @Text
    """
    ## Extension order
        
    The order in which calls to the `extend(...)` method appear in the code matters. 
    `Screenshots` and `ScreenRecorder` should usually be placed before other extensions; 
    otherwise, the content of the produced images or video files may be unexpected.

    """

    @Text 
    """
    ## Built-in and contributed extensions
    
    OPENRNDR provides a few built-in extensions to simplify common tasks. One is `Screenshots`, which is used
    to create screenshots of your programs. Another is `ScreenRecorder` which is used to write videos to files.

    Next to the built-in extensions there is [ORX](https://github.com/openrndr/orx), an extensive repository of provided and
    contributed OPENRNDR extensions and add-ons. If you work from `openrndr-template` you can easily add and remove extensions 
    from your project by editing the `orxFeatures` property in `build.gradle.kts`.
